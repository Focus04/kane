## Getting started with Glitch

1.  Create your bot account at **[Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers)**, get the token, and invite him to your server
2.  Go to **[Glitch.com](https://glitch.com)**, click **New Project**, then choose **`Clone from Git Repo`** button (we recommend you to make a Glitch account before doing this)
3.  Fill the pop-up column with **`https://github.com/zhycorp/music-bot-example.git`** at the field, then click **`OK`**
4.  Change the project's name to whatever you want (optional)
5.  Rename the **`.env_example`** to **`.env`** instead, then specify the Prefix, Bot Token, and the YouTube API v3 Key (watch [this video](https://youtu.be/-5ptk-Klfcw?t=69) for the tutorial of getting the youtube key). Don't forget with the **`PROJECT_DOMAIN`**'s value, match this value with the name of your Glitch bot project
6.  And your Discord music bot should be ready to use!

_If you have made any changes to the code, don't forget to restart the bot by typing **`refresh`** at the **`Tools > Terminal`** button._
